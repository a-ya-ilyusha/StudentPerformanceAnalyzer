## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run **StudentPerformanceAnalyzer**, you need the following installed on your system:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Apache Maven (for dependency management)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StudentPerformanceAnalyzer.git
   cd StudentPerformanceAnalyzer
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Ensure all dependencies are resolved successfully.

## Usage

### Input Format

The input Excel file should contain student performance data structured as follows:
- **Columns**: Student Name, Subject, Score
- **Rows**: Each row represents a student's score in a subject.

An example file, `example_data.xlsx`, is provided in the repository under the `resources/` folder.

### Running the Application

1. Run the application from the command line:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/StudentPerformanceAnalyzer.jar <path_to_input_file> <output_directory>
   ```

2. Parameters:
   - `<path_to_input_file>`: Path to the Excel file containing student data.
   - `<output_directory>`: Directory where the generated report and chart will be saved.

3. Example:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/StudentPerformanceAnalyzer.jar resources/example_data.xlsx output/
   ```

4. Outputs:
   - A statistical summary in `output/report.txt`.
   - A bar chart visualization saved as `output/performance_chart.png`.

---

## Example Outputs

After running the application with `example_data.xlsx`, you can expect:
1. A report detailing the count of excellent, good, satisfactory, and failing students.
2. A bar chart showing the distribution of performance categories.

Sample outputs are available in the `samples/` directory for reference.

## Known Issues

While the application has been tested extensively, the following issues may occur:
- Input files with missing or improperly formatted data may cause errors. Ensure input files are validated before processing.
- Large datasets might take longer to process or cause memory-related issues.

Future versions aim to address these concerns with better error handling and optimized performance.
